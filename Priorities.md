Steps on how to connect Wii

1) Open BlueSoleil (if not already opened) by right-click on the icon and going to "Display Classic View"
2) Search for a device under the Bluetooth menu item and add it OR
2.5) If you already see the device icon, double click on it to connect. You can also right click on the icon and go to "Connect HID device ..."

3) Now start running WiiFlash server from Desktop/Wii/WiiFlash 0.4
4) It should rumble when it connects. You may need to go back to BlueSoleil and reconnect the wii. If you open the WiiFlash app and click on the connected controller, it should rumble each time.

You should now be able to interpret Wii code from flash.
